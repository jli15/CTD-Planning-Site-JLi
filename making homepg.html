    <b>Wireframes</b>

        Today, we started making wireframes in class for the home page of our jewellery website. We worked off of several hand written ideas that we had, and each group member redid one of the ideas on Fireworks to better show the potential layout of the website. When deciding how to construct our home page, we consulted many well known jewellery websites, such as Tiffany, Cartier, and Van Cleef n Arpels. Below is my first HI-FI wireframe of our site's main page, as well as wireframes made by other members of my group:<br><img src="Wireframe.png" width="500px"><img src="wireframe%201.png" width="500px"><img src="wireframe%202.png" width="500px">
    </p>
    <b>Storyboard</b>
    <img src="storyboard%20fw.png" width="500px"><br><p>After our discussion where we shared our storyboards, I realised that the title, and especially the sidebar, were taking up too much space in the page. It pushed the pictures down so that they can't be seen unless the viewer scrolls down. For my next draft, I plan of making the sidebar with the links much smaller and moving it more to the side so that the pictures can move up. In the Dreamweaver version, I then altered my design from the original wireframe a little bit. I made the sidebar and logo smaller. I also replaced the three horizontal pictures with one large one, because the original wireframe shapes didn't fit the available jewllery photos. The larger picture makes the page look more simple and sleek, and shows the detail of the product better. </p>
    <b>Work in Dreamweaver and Fireworks</b>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="htdocs/images/index-fw.htm">Fireworks Version</a></li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Comparisons</h3>
    <p>When working in Fireworks was really simple and fast. Furthermore, I really liked the slicing function, becuase that made things more convenient. However, that same feature also made it harder to edit small, individual portions. Another downside was that I couldn't see the coding behind the wireframe I was making.</p>
    <p>Dreamweaver, on the other hand, displayed all the HTML and CSS that was involved in the page I was making. Furthermore, the pictures snapped better into the AP divs, so the end result was also a lot neater. Dreamweaver was also better with processing text and adding links, so that was more helpful in making the closer thing to the final product. A downside to Dreamweaver is that it's a little more complicated than Fireworks.</p>
    <h3>Subpages</h3>
    <p>We repeated a similar process when making the outline for our subpages. We created a wireframe in Fireworks, then we moved on to Dreamweaver to create an actual template file; they are both shown below. The template only contains the logo and navigation bar, because these are constant on every page. The content varies from page to page, as the pictures are different; furtheremore, the About Us page most likely won't have any pictures at all, so we left the entire bottom region editable. After Ankeeta and I created our template, I moved on to making all the subpages. I created the files and put in the images that we already had. I ran into some issues with the placement and alignment of the images, but I fixed it using CSS.<br>After I finished starting up all the subpages, I worked with my group to build a GitHub and Dreamweaver link so that we can collaborate on the site together. <br><br><img src="subpage%20wireframe.png" height="500"/><img src="template%20ss.png" height="500"/></p>
    <h3>WP5</h3>
    <p><b>Objectives:</b><br><ul><li>Message: Magia has a beautiful arrangement of jewellery as well as a wide variety of choices for buyers</li><li>Audience: The audience of the company is typically middle to old aged women who have money on their hands.</li><li>Purpose: The overall purpose of this website, is to actively convey Magia's products through the website. Its primary focus is to display the jewellery to otherwise unreachable markets, and the side benefit is that these products can be displayed in a fashionable way.</li></ul><br><b>For my client to be able to:</b><br><ul><li>Convey his work through a website, in which his audience is his client(s), that are focused on selling his jewelry to unreachable markets, in order to sell his products, he needs a website to reach the unavailable markets as well as attract a wider array of his audience</li></ul>
    <b>Updated Flowchart</b><br>We did not make any changes recently to our flowchart, so we're still using our previous one.<br><img src="flowchart.png" width="650"/><br><br>
    <b>Look and Feel</b><br>The overall look and feel of the website should be very simple. In the respect that the main focus area should go on the jewellery, due to the fact that the jewelry is the main purpose. We're using simple colors - black and white - for the background, in order to make the website look more sleek and simple. We want a modern and minimalist feel, so that the colors of the jewellery can stand out.<br><br>
    <b>Sitemap: Content and Navigation</b><br>The logo banner and navigation bar will be on every page, with the same placement and size. This creates more uniformity on the website, making it seem more organized and helps the audience familiarize themselves with the appearance and layout of the site. All the text will be black, and the navigation bar and description fonts will be Century. The navigation bar will be horizontal across the top of the page, right under the logo. We won't be changing the navigation bar to indicate what page the visitor is on, because our website isn't complicated, and all the subpages are shown are the navigation bar. Furthermore, the pictures of the products will be pretty self-explanatory to the audience.
